A form of mania in which the morbid state of the mind manifests itself in an irresist-able inclination or impulse to commit homicide, prompted usually by an insane delusion either as to the necessity of self-defense or the avenging of injuries, or as to tbe patient being the appointed instrument of a superhuman justice.

Socage,"Socage tenure, in Eugland, is the holding of certaiu lands in consideration of certain inferior services of husbandry to be performed by the tenant to the lord of the fee. ""Socage,” in its most general and ex-tensive signification, seems to denote a tenure by auy certain and determinate service. And in this sense it is by the ancient writers constantly put in opposition to tenure by chivalry or kuight-service, where the render was precarious and uncertain. Socage is of two sorts,—free socage, where the servlces are not only certain, but honorable; and vil-lein socage, where the services, though certain, are of baser nature. Such as hold by the former tenure are also called in Glanvil and other authors by the name of “liberi sokemanni,"" or tenants in free socage. By the statute 12 Car. 2, c. 24, all the tenures by knight-service were, with one or two im-material exceptions, converted into free and common socage. See Cowell; Bract 1. 2, c. 35; 2 Bl.
