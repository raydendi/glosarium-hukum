But the privilege of suing and beiug sued in this court was extended to the king’s accountants, and later, by the use of a convenient fiction to the effect that the plain-tiff was the king&#39;s debtor or accountant, the court was thrown open to all suitors in per-sonal actions.

The title of a statute passed ln the twenty-first year of Henry III., which in fact, however, is nothing more than a sort of writ or direction to the justices of the bench. Instructing them how the extraor-dlnary day in the leap year was to be reckoned in cases where persons had a day to appear at the distance of a year, as on the essoin de malo lecti, and the like. It was thereby directed that the additional day should, together with that which went be-fore, be reckoned only as one, and so, of course, within the preceding year. 1 Reeve, Eng. Law, 266</td>

<td>In Roman law. A law on the subject of testamentary disposi-tion, enacted by the people in the year of Rome 714, on the proposition of the tribune Falcidlus. By this law, the testator’s right to burden his estate with legacies was sub-jected to an important restriction. It pre-scribed that no one could bequeath more than three-fourths of his property in legacies, and that the heir should have at least one-fourth of the estate, and that, should the testator violate this prescript, the heir may have the right to make a proportional deduction from each legatee, so far as necessary.

He is impressed with the reality of events which have never occurred, and of things which do not exist, and acts more or less in conformity with his belief in these particulars. The mania may be general, and affect all or most of the op-era tions of the mind; or it may be partial, and be confined to particular subjects. In tbe latter case it is generally termed &#39;monomania.&#39;** In a more popular but less scientific sense, “mania” denotes a morbid or unnatural or ex-cessive craving, issuing in impulses of such fix-ity and intensity that they cannot be resisted by the patient in the enfeebled state of the will and blurred moral concepts which accompany the disease.

Monomania in general, or the obsession of a delusion or sys-tem of delusions which dominate without de-stroying the mental capacity, leaving the patient sane as to all matters outside tbeir particular range, though subject to perverted ideas, false beliefs, and uncontrollable impulses within that range; and particularly, the form of monomania where the delusion is as to wrongs, injuries, or persecution inflicted upon the patient and his consequently justifiable resentment cr r^venee. winters v.

Paranoia is called by Kraepelin “progres-sive systematized insanity,” because the delusions of being wronged or of persecution and of excessive self-esteem develop quite slowly, without independent disturbances of emotional life or of tbe will becoming prominent, and because there occurs regularly a mental working up of the delusion to form a delusionary view of the world,—in fact, a system,—leading to a derangement of tbe stand-point which the patient takes up towards the events of life.—Homicidal mania. A form of mania in which the morbid state of the mind manifests itself in an irresist-able inclination or impulse to commit homicide, prompted usually by an insane delusion either as to the necessity of self-defense or the avenging of injuries, or as to tbe patient being the appointed instrument of a superhuman justice.

Letters of marque and reprisal are grantable, by the law of nations, whenever the subjects of one state are oppressed and injured by those of another, and justice is denied by that state to which the oppressor belongs; and the par-ty to whom these letters are granted may then seize the bodies or the goods of the sub-jects of the state to which the offender be-iongs, until satisfaction be made, wherever they happen to be found. Reprisals are to be grauted only In case of a clear and open denial of Justice. At the present day, ln consequence partly of treaties and partly of the practice of nations, the making of reprisals is confined to the seizure of commer* dal property on the high seas by public cruisers, or by private cruisers specially au-thorized thereto.

See Cr. Code Ga. f 4352: Honselman v. People. 168 111. 172, 48 N. E. 304. But, strictly speaking, it should be used only os equivalent to “pederasty&quot; that is, tbe sexual act as performed by s man upon tbe person of another man or a boy by penetration of the anus. See Ausman v. Veal, 10 Ind. 355, 71 Am. Dec. 331. The term might also, without any great violence to ita original meaning, be so extended as to cover the same act wben performed in the same man* ner by a man upon the person of a woman. Another possible method of unilateral sexual connection, by penetration of tbe mouth (penem in orem alii immittcre, vcl penem alii tn orem reci pere) is not properly called “sodomy,&quot; but “fellation.” That this does not constitute sodomy within the meaning of a statute is held in Harvev v.

It is not identical with sodomy, nor is it a form of sod-omy, though thc two terms are often confused in legal writings and sometimes in statutes. See Ausman v. Veal, 10 Ind. 355, 71 Am. Dec. 331. Buggery is a term rarely nsed in stat-utea, but apparently including both sodomy (in the widest sense) and bestiality as above de-fincd. See Ausman v. Veal, 10 Ind. 355. Tl Am. Dec. 331; Com. v.

<td>Socage tenure, in Eugland, is the holding of certaiu lands in consideration of certain inferior services of husbandry to be performed by the tenant to the lord of the fee. &quot;Socage,” in its most general and ex-tensive signification, seems to denote a tenure by auy certain and determinate service. And in this sense it is by the ancient writers constantly put in opposition to tenure by chivalry or kuight-service, where the render was precarious and uncertain. Socage is of two sorts,—free socage, where the servlces are not only certain, but honorable; and vil-lein socage, where the services, though certain, are of baser nature. Such as hold by the former tenure are also called in Glanvil and other authors by the name of “liberi sokemanni,&quot; or tenants in free socage. By the statute 12 Car. 2, c. 24, all the tenures by knight-service were, with one or two im-material exceptions, converted into free and common socage. See Cowell; Bract 1. 2, c. 35; 2 Bl.
