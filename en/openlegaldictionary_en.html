It wus origiuuily the kiug’s treas-ury, and was charged with keeping the king&#39;s accounts and collecting the royal revenues. But pleas between subject and subject were anciently heard there, untii this was for-bidden by the Artivula super Cliartas, (1290,) after which its jurisdiction as a court oniy extended to revenue cases arising out of the non-payment or withholding of debts to the crown. But the privilege of suing and beiug sued in this court was extended to the king’s accountants, and later, by the use of a convenient fiction to the effect that the plain-tiff was the king&#39;s debtor or accountant, the court was thrown open to all suitors in per-sonal actions.

In this sense it is the contrary of de jure, which means rightful, legitimate, just, or constitutional. Thus, an officer, king, or government de facto is one who is in actual possession of the ofiice or supreme power, but by usurpation, or without respect to lawful title; while an officer, klng, or governor de jure is one who has just claim and rightful title to tlie office or power, but who has never had plenary possession of the same, or is not now in actual possession. 4 Bl.

In medieval history these fraternities or guilds played an important part ln the government of some states; as at Florence, in the thirteenth and following centuries, where they chose the council of government of the city. But with the growth of cities and the ad-vance in the organization of municipal gov-ernment, thelr importance and prestige has declined. The place of meeting of a guild, or assoclatlon of guilds, was called the “Guildhall.” The word Is said to be derived from the Anglo-Saxon “gild” or “geld,” a tax or tribute, because each member of the society was required to pay a tax towards its support</td>

<td>erangement Is accompanied with more or less of excitement. Sometimes the excitement amounts to a fury. The individual ln such cases is subject to hallucinations and illusions. He is impressed with the reality of events which have never occurred, and of things which do not exist, and acts more or less in conformity with his belief in these particulars. The mania may be general, and affect all or most of the op-era tions of the mind; or it may be partial, and be confined to particular subjects. In tbe latter case it is generally termed &#39;monomania.&#39;** In a more popular but less scientific sense, “mania” denotes a morbid or unnatural or ex-cessive craving, issuing in impulses of such fix-ity and intensity that they cannot be resisted by the patient in the enfeebled state of the will and blurred moral concepts which accompany the disease. It is used in this sense in such compounds as “homicidal mania,” “dipsomania,&quot; and the like.—Hypomania. A mild or slight-ly developed form or type of mania.—Mono-mania. A perversion or derangement of tbe reason or understanding with reference to a single subject or small claas of subjects, with considerable mental excitement and delusions,^ while, as to all matters outs&#39;de the range of the&#39; peculiar infirmity, the intellectual faculties remain unimpaired and function normal y.

Monomania in general, or the obsession of a delusion or sys-tem of delusions which dominate without de-stroying the mental capacity, leaving the patient sane as to all matters outside tbeir particular range, though subject to perverted ideas, false beliefs, and uncontrollable impulses within that range; and particularly, the form of monomania where the delusion is as to wrongs, injuries, or persecution inflicted upon the patient and his consequently justifiable resentment cr r^venee. winters v.

Paranoia is called by Kraepelin “progres-sive systematized insanity,” because the delusions of being wronged or of persecution and of excessive self-esteem develop quite slowly, without independent disturbances of emotional life or of tbe will becoming prominent, and because there occurs regularly a mental working up of the delusion to form a delusionary view of the world,—in fact, a system,—leading to a derangement of tbe stand-point which the patient takes up towards the events of life.—Homicidal mania. A form of mania in which the morbid state of the mind manifests itself in an irresist-able inclination or impulse to commit homicide, prompted usually by an insane delusion either as to the necessity of self-defense or the avenging of injuries, or as to tbe patient being the appointed instrument of a superhuman justice.

Letters of marque and reprisal are grantable, by the law of nations, whenever the subjects of one state are oppressed and injured by those of another, and justice is denied by that state to which the oppressor belongs; and the par-ty to whom these letters are granted may then seize the bodies or the goods of the sub-jects of the state to which the offender be-iongs, until satisfaction be made, wherever they happen to be found. Reprisals are to be grauted only In case of a clear and open denial of Justice. At the present day, ln consequence partly of treaties and partly of the practice of nations, the making of reprisals is confined to the seizure of commer* dal property on the high seas by public cruisers, or by private cruisers specially au-thorized thereto.

And in this sense it is by the ancient writers constantly put in opposition to tenure by chivalry or kuight-service, where the render was precarious and uncertain. Socage is of two sorts,—free socage, where the servlces are not only certain, but honorable; and vil-lein socage, where the services, though certain, are of baser nature. Such as hold by the former tenure are also called in Glanvil and other authors by the name of “liberi sokemanni,&quot; or tenants in free socage. By the statute 12 Car. 2, c. 24, all the tenures by knight-service were, with one or two im-material exceptions, converted into free and common socage. See Cowell; Bract 1. 2, c. 35; 2 Bl.

See Cr. Code Ga. f 4352: Honselman v. People. 168 111. 172, 48 N. E. 304. But, strictly speaking, it should be used only os equivalent to “pederasty&quot; that is, tbe sexual act as performed by s man upon tbe person of another man or a boy by penetration of the anus. See Ausman v. Veal, 10 Ind. 355, 71 Am. Dec. 331. The term might also, without any great violence to ita original meaning, be so extended as to cover the same act wben performed in the same man* ner by a man upon the person of a woman. Another possible method of unilateral sexual connection, by penetration of tbe mouth (penem in orem alii immittcre, vcl penem alii tn orem reci pere) is not properly called “sodomy,&quot; but “fellation.” That this does not constitute sodomy within the meaning of a statute is held in Harvev v.
